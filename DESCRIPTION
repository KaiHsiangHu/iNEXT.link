Description: iNEXT.link is an R package that extends the concepts of iNEXT.3D (Chao et al., 2021), 
             iNEXT.4step (Chao et al., 2020) and iNEXT.beta3D (Chao et al., 2023) to ecological 
             networks (Chiu et al., 2023). It is designed to calculate and analyze various measures 
             of diversity in ecological networks. Specifically, the package calculates three Hill 
             numbers of order q (species richness, Shannon diversity, and Simpson diversity) in 
             taxonomic diversity (TD) level, as well as their generalizations (Hill-Chao numbers) 
             for phylogenetic diversity (PD) and functional diversity (FD) levels. For individual 
             ecological networks, iNEXT.link provides tools for rarefaction and extrapolation (R/E), 
             enabling diversity estimation and confidence intervals under both size-based and 
             coverage-based standardization. Asymptotic 3D network diversity estimates are also 
             available (see Chao et al., 2021). In addition, iNEXT.link offers dissimilarity-turnover 
             curves based on coverage-based R/E for gamma, alpha, and beta diversity, allowing 
             cross-network comparison of diversity patterns (see Chao et al., 2023). 
             The package also assesses sample completeness for networks and supports coverage-based 
             rarefaction and extrapolation for estimating specialization using five unevenness-based 
             indices (see Chao et al., 2020).
