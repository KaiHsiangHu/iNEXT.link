\title{ggplot2 extension for output from \code{iNEXT.link}}
\usage{
ggiNEXT.link(
  output,
  type = c(1, 2, 3),
  facet.var = "Assemblage",
  color.var = "Order.q"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{output}{an \code{iNEXT.link} object computed by \code{iNEXT.link}.}

\item{type}{three types of plots: sample-size-based rarefaction/extrapolation curve (\code{type = 1}); 
sample completeness curve (\code{type = 2}); coverage-based rarefaction/extrapolation curve (\code{type = 3}).}

\item{facet.var}{create a separate plot for each value of a specified variable: 
no separation (\code{facet.var = "None"}); 
a separate plot for each diversity order (\code{facet.var = "Order.q"}); 
a separate plot for each assemblage (\code{facet.var = "Assemblage"}); 
a separate plot for each combination of diversity order and assemblage (\code{facet.var = "Both"}).}

\item{color.var}{create curves in different colors for values of a specified variable:
all curves are in the same color (\code{color.var = "None"}); 
use different colors for diversity orders (\code{color.var = "Order.q"}); 
use different colors for assemblages/sites (\code{color.var = "Assemblage"}); 
use different colors for combinations of diversity orders and assemblage (\code{color.var = "Both"}).}
}
\value{
a \code{ggplot2} object for sample-size-based rarefaction/extrapolation curve (\code{type = 1}), sample completeness curve (\code{type = 2}), and coverage-based rarefaction/extrapolation curve (\code{type = 3}).
}
\description{
\code{ggiNEXT.link} is a \code{ggplot} extension for an \code{iNEXT.link} object to plot sample-size- and coverage-based rarefaction/extrapolation sampling curves along with a bridging sample completeness curve.
